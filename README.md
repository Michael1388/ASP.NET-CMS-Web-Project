# ASP.NET CMS Web Project
 
This is the summary of my two-week internship with Prosper IT Consulting which was the last coding project I was involved in while studying at the Tech Academy. Here I participated remotely in the building out of an ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework content management service (aka CMS) website. 

The project involved the creation of an interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company.
The website was created with users in mind who are not technically savvy and want to easily manage what displays on their website.

 I came into the project mid way through development, initially reviewing code and documentation before beginning work. My contirbution to the team I worked with involved setting up and styling the About page, then setting up the Rental History specific area of the website that I was assigned to in our sprint. By the end of the sprint, I had completed six important parts of the website. 
 
 I will show and link the parts I contributed to throughout this summary, with links and code highliting the specific areas I created as a sample of the skills I've attained and have to offer as an entry level junior developer.
