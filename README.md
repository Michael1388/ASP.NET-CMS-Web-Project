# ASP.NET_CMS_Web_Project
 
This is the summary of my two-week internship with Prosper IT Consulting. Here I participated in the building out of an ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework content management service (aka CMS). 
The project involved the creation of an interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company.
The website was created with users in mind who are not technically savvy and want to easily manage what displays in their website.
